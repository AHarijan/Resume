                            <p>With a keen interest in data analytics, an individual from a management background ventured into the field of data analysis. The journey was indeed challenging, but as a wise person once said, "When the why is clear, the how is easy."  <br>  <br>Through self-learning, excellent mentorship, and the help of some intelligent individuals, I was able to acquire analytical skills and master various analytical tools. Starting with MS Excel and progressing to Python, my skillset expanded significantly over the years. Each step of the journey brought new insights and experiences that were both rewarding and enlightening.  <br> <br> The support from mentors and peers was invaluable in overcoming the hurdles faced along the way. Looking back, the past seven years have been a fantastic journey of growth and learning. I am grateful for the opportunities and the knowledge gained, which have paved the way for a successful career in data analytics.

                            <h3>Data Analysis</h3>
                            <p>In my current role as a Data Analyst, I am involved in data collection, data transformation, automation, report generation, and publishing reports to various stakeholders. I achieve these tasks using tools such as PowerPoint, Excel, Power Query, Power BI, and to some extent, Python. <br>  <br>

                                Below are some of the tasks I perform: <br>
                                
                                -Track KPIs and improve performance. <br>
                                
                                -Track vessels and keep our clients updated on vessel positions. <br>
                                
                                -Create dashboards to measure the performance of the billing process. <br>
                                
                                -Identify key players in the market so that our commercial team can approach the right customers. <br>

                            <h3>Data Designing</h3>
                            <p>Analysis and automation become easy and quick to complete when data collection is properly organized. Time-consuming and effort-intensive activities can thus be eliminated. Therefore, I believe in setting up my own data collection systems in the form of modern web pages and web forms with pre-validation setups.  <br> <br> I utilize my knowledge in front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as back-end technologies including PHP, Python, Node.js, React.js, and others.  <br> <br>By creating these custom solutions, I ensure that the data collection process is efficient and reliable, ultimately leading to better analysis and insights. This comprehensive approach not only streamlines my workflow but also enhances the accuracy and quality of the data collected.</p>

                            <p>As a mentor, I develop leadership and communication skills. Teaching others not only reinforces my own knowledge but also reveals new perspectives. I mentor students and working professionals in analytical tools and techniques. It's a way to give back to our community.  <br> <br> By sharing my expertise, I help them grow and achieve their goals. The satisfaction of seeing their progress is immensely rewarding. Mentoring also allows me to stay current with new trends and technologies in the field, ensuring that both I and my mentees remain at the forefront of industry developments.</p>
